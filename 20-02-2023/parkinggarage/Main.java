// 6. A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an
// additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge
// for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.
// Write an application that calculates and displays the parking charges for each customer who parked in
// the garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each customer. The program should display
// the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running total of yesterdayâ€™s
// receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer.
